Linear Algebra in Deep Learning 

The mathematical operations underlying deep learning studies, matrix, vector, tensor will be studied.

Neural networks store weights in matrices. Performs linear algebra matrix operations quickly and easily, especially when training on GPUs. In fact, GPUs are built with vector and matrix operations in mind. Rather than processing pixels one by one, GPUs process all matrices of pixels in parallel.
